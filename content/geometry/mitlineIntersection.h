 * Description: If a unique intersection point of the lines going through s1,e1 and s2,e2 exists r is set to this point and 1 is returned. If no intersection point exists 0 is returned and if infinitely many exists -1 is returned. If s1==e1 or s2==e2 -1 is returned. The wrong position will be returned if P is Point<int> and the intersection point does not have integer coordinates. Products of three coordinates are used in intermediate steps so watch out for overflow if using int or long long.
 * Status: tested
 * Usage: 
 * 	point<double> intersection;
 * 	if (1 == LineIntersection(s1,e1,s2,e2,intersection))
 * 		cout << "intersection point at " << intersection << endl;
